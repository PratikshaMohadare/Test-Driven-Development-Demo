# Test-Driven-Development-Demo



Being a software developer we must always aspire to write quality code. We must also make sure that any future code we write does not break existing features. Test Driven Development provides us with a great way to implement software. It provides a safety net, which allows us to make changes with confidence. In this project, I have demonstrated how to apply the principles of test driven development in iOS using Swift language.

This demo project created using SwiftUI with a focus on Test-Driven Development (TDD):

Introducing a Tip Calculator built using SwiftUI, this project showcases the power of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in creating robust and reliable applications. Whether you're a SwiftUI enthusiast or a TDD advocate, this project highlights the seamless synergy between technology and best development practices.

TDD, or Test-Driven Development, is a software development methodology that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. This approach is often used to ensure that the code meets the specified requirements and functions correctly. In Swift, TDD is a valuable practice for building robust and maintainable applications.
